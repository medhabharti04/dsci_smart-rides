Smart Rides Optimization with Data Science

Problem Statement
Smart Rides is a ride-sharing platform that faces challenges such as predicting ride types, estimating fares accurately, detecting fraudulent behavior, and understanding customer patterns. Inefficiencies in these areas affect customer satisfaction and operational performance.

Objective
The objective of this project is to apply data science techniques to optimize key components of Smart Rides services. This includes ride classification, fare prediction, fraud detection, and customer behavior analysis.

Dataset Description
The dataset was collected from Kaggle and contains one month of ride-sharing data. It includes details such as customer ID, ride distance, fare, vehicle type, booking status, and timestamps.

Tools and Techniques Used
EDA was performed using Power BI to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.
Preprocessing included missing value imputation, data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling.
Modeling was implemented in Python using the following techniques:

XGBoost and Logistic Regression for ride type prediction

Linear Regression and ARIMA for fare prediction

Isolation Forest and DBSCAN for anomaly detection

K-Means for clustering rides based on distance

Apriori and FP-Growth for association rule mining

Results
XGBoost achieved 92.4 percent accuracy in ride type classification.
Linear Regression provided an R-squared score of 85.7 percent for fare prediction.
K-Means successfully segmented rides into short, medium, and long categories.
Anomaly detection techniques identified unusual cancellations and fare patterns.

Future Scope
Implement real-time fare optimization using reinforcement learning.
Deploy models into production for live predictions.
Enhance dynamic driver allocation strategies.
